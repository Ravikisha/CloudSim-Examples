This project simulates scheduling in a cloud computing environment using **CloudSim**. Multiple scheduling algorithms are implemented, allowing for flexibility in assigning tasks (cloudlets) to virtual machines (VMs).

## Features

- Implemented scheduling algorithms:
  - Round Robin
  - First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Genetic Algorithm
  - Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)

## How It Works

1. **Create Datacenter and VMs:** A datacenter with a pool of VMs is initialized.
2. **Cloudlets:** Multiple cloudlets (tasks) are created, each representing a unit of workload.
3. **Scheduling:** The user can select an algorithm to schedule cloudlets to VMs.
4. **Algorithms:** Based on the selected algorithm, the cloudlets are assigned to VMs in an optimized manner.
5. **Simulation:** The CloudSim engine runs the simulation and outputs the scheduling results.

## Algorithms Usage

```bash
Enter the algorithm to be used: (roundrobin, fcfs, ant, genetic, sjf): genetic
```

Choose any of the following algorithms:
- **roundrobin:** Round-robin scheduling.
- **fcfs:** First-Come-First-Serve scheduling.
- **ant:** Ant Colony Optimization scheduling.
- **genetic:** Genetic Algorithm-based scheduling.
- **sjf:** Shortest Job First scheduling.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- CloudSim library

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ravikisha/cloudsim-scheduling
    ```
2. Add the [CloudSim library](http://www.cloudbus.org/cloudsim/) to your project.
3. Compile and run the project:
    ```bash
    javac CloudSimDemo.java
    java CloudSimDemo
    ```

## Example Output
